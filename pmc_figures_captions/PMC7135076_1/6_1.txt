Figure: Chest x-rays and chest CTs of three patientsCase 1: chest x-ray was obtained on Jan 1 (1A). The brightness of both lungs was diffusely decreased, showinga large area of patchy shadow with uneven density. Tracheal intubation was seen in the trachea and the heartshadow outline was not clear. The catheter shadow was seen from the right axilla to the mediastinum. Bilateraldiaphragmatic surface and costal diaphragmatic angle were not clear, and chest x-ray on Jan 2 showed worsestatus (1B). Case 2: chest x-ray obtained on Jan 6 (2A). The brightness of both lungs was decreased and multiplepatchy shadows were observed; edges were blurred, and large ground-glass opacity and condensation shadowswere mainly on the lower right lobe. Tracheal intubation could be seen in the trachea. Heart shadow roughlypresents in the normal range. On the left side, the diaphragmatic surface is not clearly displayed. The right side ofthe diaphragmatic surface was light and smooth and rib phrenic angle was less sharp. Chest x-ray on Jan 10showed worse status (2B). Case 3: chest CT obtained on Jan 1 (3A) showed mass shadows of high density in bothlungs. Bright bronchogram is seen in the lung tissue area of the lesion, which is also called bronchoinflation sign.Chest CT on Jan 15 showed improved status (3B).
